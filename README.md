# pdf-lib-builder

This is an automatic page creation library for [pdf-lib](https://github.com/Hopding/pdf-lib).
It is thought to be an alternative to [pdfkit](https://github.com/foliojs/pdfkit) for users that actually had to use both of the libraries (like me ðŸ˜…).

## Example

Please look at the [example](https://github.com/Patcher56/pdf-lib-builder/tree/main/example) folder for a fully working example with a simple node server.

## Usage

To start you simply create an instance of the document builder class and wrap the doc inside:

```ts
// First create a PDFDocument like you would usually do.
const doc = await PDFDocument.create();

// Now create a PDFDocumentBuilder instance and wrap the doc inside.
const builder = new PDFDocumentBuilder(doc);
```

Next you can use some functions to build up your document.

**For easier layouting the library changes the origin on all functions from bottom left to top left.**

### Create a text

```ts
builder.text("Hello world.");
```

It automatically goes to the next line when writing a text. You can pass the default `pdf-lib`-options to the `text` function.

### Moving

```ts
builder.moveDown(1);
```

You can pass the amount of **lines** to move down. This is calculated by the current font size.
